# poker
Writing a poker game program + a poker ai which will count cards and use machine learning to compete vs real players or other bots.

In this project we will be using a number of files to create a fully functioning poker game as well as an AI player. 

card.cpp: implementation of all cards used in a poker game
pack.cpp: implements a pack of cards. 

player.cpp: implementation of an AI player who will use statistical analysis to make decisions during the game, and will use machine learning to adapt to different players' playstyle over the course of a game.

main.cpp: implementation of both a single round of poker and an entire game, played until one player reaches a specified amount of money/wins, or until a specified number of rounds have been played. The game's players can be any mix of AI and human players.
